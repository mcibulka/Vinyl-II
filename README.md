# Vinyl-II
This file outlines the guidelines and practices to be followed throughout development.  By following the same processes, development efforts will be consistent and the application will feel like one cohesive unit.  Following these processes will also ensure minimal rework.   

## GitHub Flow
The development process is based on the recommended flow by GitHub:  
  1. Create a branch  
  2. Add commits  
  3. Open a Pull Request  
  4. Discuss and review your code  
  5. Deploy  
  6. Merge  

See, [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## File Name Conventions
When creating a new file (e.g. source code, resource) name it by following these conventions: 
  - **Descriptive** : contents immediately identifiable   
  - **Concise** : descriptive with minimal number of words
  - **Avoid Short Forms** : proper english, and more readable, e.g. *Library* vs. Lib
  - **CamelCase** : each word begins with a capital, and no spaces between words
